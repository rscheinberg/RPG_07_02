This mini-RPG game lets you choose a difficulty 1-3, with one being the easiest. Then you state your name (you're a protagonist) and choose whatever class you'd like to be, from a KillerRobot to Medic. You walk across a forest and have a random chance of encountering a monster, based on your difficulty. While you, the protagonist, is alive, you can fight these monsters. You have many options on what to do, from attacking, feeling lucky, normalizing, etc. When you've died or you've left the forest, a message will pop up, telling you the game is over.
